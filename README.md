# Deque Interface (by Square: Ricky Lin, Simon Tsui, Kyle Tau)

Our Deque interface contains all the methods of the java api. We will use doubly linked nodes as the containers for Deque, because nodes have pointers to the nodes next to them. It has more depth than an arraylist, which is just a list of elements next to each other. With arraylists, either enqueue or dequeue could be linear, or with the cloud method there would have to be a method deep copying the list. With nodes we do not need to do this. 

# To Do Plan:
0) Create class QQKachoo to implement Deque interface.
1) Implement size() method.
2) Implement all forms of add, remove, and get (and element() in place of get()).
3) Implement contains() method.
3.5) Check over implemented methods, make sure they are efficient.
4) Implement iterator-based methods.
5) Finish implementation.
