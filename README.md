# Deque

Our Deque interface contains all the methods of the java api. We will use singly linked nodes as the containers for Deque.

# To Do Plan:
0) Create class QQKachoo to implement Deque interface.
1) Implement size() method.
2) Implement all forms of add, remove, and get.
3) Implement contains() method.
3.5) Check over implemented methods
4) Implement similar methods of add, remove, and get (pop(), push(), peek(), offer(), etc.).
5) Implement iterator-based methods.
6) Finish implementation.
